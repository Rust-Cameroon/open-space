# open-space
Submit your rust related open source projects so we can collaborate and make it a success together

Our goal in the Rust-Cameroon community is to build the opensource solutions our country needs and beyond. This Repository is a crowdsourced collection of project ideas submitted by the community and that might require our amazing pool of contributors to work on.

Checkout the [project ideas](https://github.com/Rust-Cameroon/open-space/issues) submitted by the community.

### You have an idea

Feel free to submit a project idea on this [repository](https://github.com/Rust-Cameroon/open-space/issues).

Once you have submited your idea, the community will be notified and you will be invited to describe your idea clearly to us.

### You are a developer

If you are a developer looking for a cool open source project to work on, checkout this list of projects ideas.

The projects have a set of labels that indicates the status and or complexity of the project.
### Status

1. Started - *The project is currently under development*
2. Done - *The project had a v1 release, and is being actively maintened*
3. Stalled - *The project hasn't progressed a lot in a while, and have no active maintainers*

Depending on the status of the project you may decide to join a project that is currently under development, pick up a project that has not started yet or grab a stalled project to make it move forward.
